## Information We Collect

This extension does not require users to register an account or provide any personal information.

### Automatically Collected Information

When you use this extension to share sessions, we process the following information:

- **Cookie Data**: Only when you actively choose the "Copy Session" function, the extension will read the cookie information of the current website. This cookie information is only saved on your device and encrypted in your clipboard.

The information we collect is only used for the following purposes:

- Providing session sharing functionality, allowing you to share website login status with trusted friends

## Data Storage

All processed data is stored on the user's local device:

- Cookie data is encrypted and temporarily stored in the user's clipboard
- We do not transfer or store any data to external servers
- We do not use any remote databases or cloud storage services

## Data Sharing

Session Share **does not** share your data with any third parties. When you use this extension to share sessions, the shared session data is controlled by you, and we are not involved in this process.

## Security

We take the following measures to protect your information:

- Using AES encryption algorithm to encrypt cookie data in the clipboard
